In double equality operator, the operators take our equality in terms of limited time duration. If operands are not dependent, javascript will attempt to convert them into the common type before comparing. For example, 1 double equal to single equal to 1 will return true because javascript requests the string single equal to 1 to the number 1 before comparing. On the other hand, triple equality should not be an equality operator. These are the predictions for the equality without dependent time duration. It returns true if the operands are of the same type and have same value. For example, 1 triple equal to 1 will return false if the operands are of different type. In this order, double equality offers a time duration before comparison, while triple equality does not.
